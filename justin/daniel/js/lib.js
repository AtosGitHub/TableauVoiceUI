var addLibrary = ['add', 'plus', 'put in'];
var removeLibrary = ['remove', 'reduce', 'delete'];
var allLibrary = ['reset','all', 'everything', 'clear'];



These are the word lists that Daniel has come up with to indicate types of filtering. 
Can you make a .txt file for each variable containing comma-delimited rhyiming words for each.

e.g. : 
	var addLibrary = ['add', 'plus', 'put in'];
	var rhymesWithAdd = ['ad', 'at', 'pulse', 'pauase', 'but in', 'got in'];
