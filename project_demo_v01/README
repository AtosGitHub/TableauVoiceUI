	item: "getSheetNames" demonstraits calling function getSheetNames() which prints and returns an array containing all tab names.

	item: "getSheetList" Sheets are part of SheetList, which are handled by the tableau code, and the speech team should not worry too much about it, but if you're curious full sheet list can be printed and returned using getSheetList button/method
